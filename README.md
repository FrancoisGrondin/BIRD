# BIRD: Big Impulse Response Dataset

BIRD is an open dataset that consists of 1,000,000 multichannel room impulse responses generated using the image method.
This makes it the **largest multichannel open dataset currently available**.
We provide some Python code that shows how to download and use this dataset to perform online data augmentation.
The code is compatible with the PyTorch dataset class, which eases integration in existing deep learning projects based on this framework.

## Download the dataset

There are two ways to download the BIRD dataset: using the python script (recommended) or direct download.

### Using Python script

Here's how to quickly install and use the dataset:

1. Install required libraries:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download the complete dataset and store it on your hardware (11.3 GB):

```
python3 tools/download.py
```

or you can downloads parts of the dataset with the --fold argument such as:

```
python3 tools/download.py --folds 1
```

### Direct download

You can download directly the dataset [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4139416).

## Visualize the dataset

We can visualize a sample from the dataset. Suppose we want to look at the fourth sample in the dataset, we would use the following commands:

### Show the room configuration

Launch the following script:

```
python3 tools/visualize.py --view room --item 4
```

Which returns the following plot:

![Room configuration](/images/room.png)

The microphones are displayed by the black dots whereas the sources are the colored dots

### Show the room impulse responses

Launch the following script:

```
python3 tools/visualize.py --view rir --item 4
```

Which returns the following plot:

![Room Impulse Responses](/images/rir.png)

### Display the META data

To see the metadatas as presented in the article, launch the following script:

```
python3 tools/visualize.py --view meta --item 4
```

Which prints the following string in the terminal:

```
{
    'L': [14.83, 11.49, 3.01], 
    'alpha': 0.36,
    'c': 350.5,
    'mics': [[14.141, 2.934, 1.895], 
             [14.224, 3.010, 2.161]],
    'srcs': [[0.811, 5.702, 1.547], 
             [6.658, 4.000, 2.582], 
             [5.340, 9.433, 1.775], 
             [12.164, 8.109, 2.161]]
}
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples that show how BIRD can be used to perform data augmentation.

### Sound Source Localization

Launch the following script:

```
python3 examples/sound_source_localization.py
```

Which outputs the following spectrograms:

![SSL Spectrogram](/images/ssl_spex.png)

And generates the following TDOAs:

```
tensor([-2.3261,  2.0721], dtype=torch.float64)
```

### Reverberation Time Estimation

Launch the following script:

```
python3 examples/reverberation_time_estimation.py
```

Which outputs the following spectrograms:

![RT60 Spectrogram](/images/rt60_spex.png)

And generates the following RT60:

```
0.416
```

### Counting Speech Sources

Launch the following script:

```
python3 examples/counting_speech_sources.py
```

Which outputs the following spectrograms:

![CNT Spectrogram](/images/cnt_spex.png)

And generates the following source count:

```
3
```

### Ideal Ratio Mask Estimation

Launch the following script:

```
python3 examples/ideal_ratio_mask_estimation.py
```

Which outputs the following spectrograms:

![IRM Spectrogram](/images/irm_spex.png)

And the following ideal ratio mask:

![IRM Mask](/images/irm_mask.png)

And the target TDOA:

```
-2.3261
```
